<p>7.5 (12.75/13)<br>NullPointer in addIncomingLink() [-0.25]<br>NullPointer in calculateIncomingLinks() [no further point deduction]<br>&nbsp;<br>7.6 (5/5)<br><br>7.7 (2/2)<br><br>Total:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (19.75/20)<br><br><br>Note: <br>If you're thinking of writing me an e-mail telling me why I should give you some of your points back, you will have to also tell me *exactly what* I have to change in *exactly where* in your code for something to work. If the change is small and the test passes, you most likely will get some points back. This applies to future homework too!<br>This message was sent to all the people whose homework I have corrected, so please do not take it personally.<br></p>
